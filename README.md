# Recursion

[Recursion in programming - FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/IJDJ0kBx2LM)


Recursion is a powerful technique that helps us bridge the gap between complex problems being solved with elegant code. Within this course, we will break down what recursion is, why you would and wouldn’t want to use it and look at a variety of examples for how it can be used.

We’ll break down recursion with all sorts of data-structures, animations, debugging and call-stack analysis to get a deeper understanding to these principles.

The code is written in Java, but the principles are agnostic to any language.
